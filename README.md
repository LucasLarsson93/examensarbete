# Laravel 11 Forum

## Built by Lucas Larsson

### I've built this forum as a examination/graduation project. The framework I used for this web application is Laravel (version 11) and one of my goals was to use as much from Laravel as possible

### The forum uses Laravel Breeze with a modified migration which adds the column is_admin to the users table. Laravel version 11 by default comes with postgress but however I changed this to mysql. In order to run the project on a local enviroment I also installed a MariaDB server and placed the project within Laravel Herd. Node is used in order to make the development as easy as possible. By default this application also comes with Tailwind Css but I also imported SCSS with help from Vite

### The website for this project will be accessible in the description
