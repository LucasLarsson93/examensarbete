# Forum built with Laravel by Lucas Larsson

## I've built this forum as a examination project. The framework I used for this project is Laravel and one of my goals was to use as much from Laravel as possible

## The forum uses Laravel Breeze with a modified migration which adds the column is_admin to the users table in order to. Laravel 11 by default comes with postgress but however I changed this to mysql. In order to run the project on a local enviroment I also installed a MariaDB server and I used Laravel Herd and Node in order to make the development as easy as possible

### I will share links to the project below once it has been deployed
